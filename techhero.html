            <h1>Katherine Johnson</h1>

                Katherine Johnson was a pioneering mathematician whose calculations were crucial to NASA’s space missions. 
                Born in 1918, she showed exceptional mathematical skills from an early age, attending high school at just ten years old. 
                As one of the first African-American women at NASA, she helped calculate trajectories for **Project Mercury** and the **Apollo 11 Moon landing**. 
                Her expertise ensured astronaut John Glenn’s successful orbit around Earth, as he insisted she personally verify the computer's calculations. 
                Despite facing racial and gender barriers, Johnson’s brilliance and determination paved the way for women in STEM. 
                In 2015, she received the **Presidential Medal of Freedom**, and her story was brought to light in the film *Hidden Figures*. 
                Her legacy lives on as a trailblazer in aerospace technology, inspiring future generations to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

            <h1>Elon Musk</h1>

            <p>
                Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, although quite a controversial figure as of lately, is the tech hero I chose. 
                The reason I chose him is become I highly value freedom of speech and intellectual discussion and when he bought Twitter,
                he restored freedom of speech on the platform. He also exposed the weaponization of censorship and how it can be used to supress
                dissenting opinions regarding important topics such as COVID-19. Aside from this, he is obviously an exceptionally successful person
                who is now also spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency. Although unpopular amongst some, I believe that by ridding the Government
                of ineffective intermediary forces, he is creating a pathway to not only hold government officials accountable but also making it possible for the 
                American people to have their voices heard more directly.
