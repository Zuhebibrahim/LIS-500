                    Katherine Johnson was a pioneering mathematician whose calculations were crucial to NASA’s space
                    missions.
                    Born in 1918, she showed exceptional mathematical skills from an early age, attending high school at
                    just ten years old.
                    As one of the first African-American women at NASA, she helped calculate trajectories for
                    <strong>Project Mercury</strong>
                    and the <strong>Apollo 11 Moon landing</strong>. Her expertise ensured astronaut John Glenn’s
                    successful orbit around Earth,
                    as he insisted she personally verify the computer's calculations. Despite facing racial and gender
                    barriers,
                    Johnson’s brilliance and determination paved the way for women in STEM. In 2015, she received the
                    <strong>Presidential Medal of Freedom</strong>,
                    and her story was brought to light in the film <em>Hidden Figures</em>.

                    Elon Musk, known for founding Tesla and SpaceX, is a complex figure in modern tech.
                    As a South African immigrant and nontraditional tech leader, his path reflects how global
                    backgrounds
                    intersect with Silicon Valley innovation. While his stances on free speech and social media policies
                    are debated, his role in shifting public discourse about tech and power is undeniable.
                    However, this also raises critical questions about who gets to shape digital platforms and whose
                    voices are elevated.
                    His inclusion here is meant to spark dialogue, not serve as a definitive endorsement.
